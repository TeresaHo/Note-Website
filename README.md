# Note-Website

given the same requirement.txt, pip doesn't always produce the same environment
You can't really replicate the same environment you have on your development machine in production
The typical solution to this problem is to use pip freeze. This command allows you to get exact versions for all third party libraries
Thsi solution unfortunately leads to another whole new problem
As you can see in this situation, the responsibility of staying up to date with necessary updates falls on you
